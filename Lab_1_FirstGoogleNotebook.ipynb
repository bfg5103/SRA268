The bottom side of the graph represents the individual dates of each day in the month of May. The red line corresponds to the maximum temperature for that day, while the blue line corresponds to the minimum temperature for that day.\n"

        "# Conclusion\n",
        "As you can see from the graph, the maximum and minimum temperatures were increasing throughout the month of May. I believe this was because the summer season was approaching, ultimatly causing the overall temperature to rise. An interesting thing to note was how drastically the temperature spiked between May 14 and May 19. However, it then decreased again throughout the rest of the month. I believe a double line graph is the best way to approach this data because you can easily see what the min and max temperature was for each individual day. Additionally, you can see the temperature trend throughout the month of May for this specific year."
