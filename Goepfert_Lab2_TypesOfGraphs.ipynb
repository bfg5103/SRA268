The red bars represent total points scored when the team lost, and the green bar represents total points scored when the team won. This type of color coding is known as retinal visual encoding because it makes it easier to understand at first glance. This graph really highlights which teams score the most points. For example, Duke's bar stretches very far in both directions. When looking at Villanova, they strecth very little. Therefore, I laerned that Duke scored much more points than Villanova, even when they won or lost. Overall, this graph makes it clear which teams scored the most points, regardless of the outcome."

This type of graph highlights the trends in data, therefore it is clear to see that total win points scored per year has fluctuated.

This type of graph was super interesting to make because it \"binned\" my data together, highlighting which day had more points scored than others. Each day of the week has its own \"bin\", and then win points and lose points for that day are inside. Win points are represented in green, while lose points are in red. This type of visual encoding is called retinal, as the data is structured for the human eye to understand upon first look. Due to this layout of data, I learned that the most win points scored and lose points scored occured on a Thursday. This leads me to believe that most March Madness games took place on a Thursday. "

Additionally, each day of the week has its own color, in order to highlight which day dominates the pie. This is called retinal visual encoding, where the colors and the size of the \"slice\" are used to help represent data.
